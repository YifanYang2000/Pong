# Pong
That's right. One of the old classics using the turtle and os modules on Python.

### Let's try it out!
Create a folder and download all of the files above. <br />
Open the folder using your editor. <br />
Run the programm and an UI with the game should pop up immediately. <br />
Happy gaming!

### Improvements?
I would like to make the ball increase in speed each time it bounces on a pad (the speed eventually resets to its original value once a player scores). <br />
A pausing and restart option. <br />
Stay tuned for updates!
